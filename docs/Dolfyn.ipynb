    "# Dolfyn's influence on MiniCombust\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot about the core flow solver and Langrangian particle interaction that is heavily inspired by [Dolfyn](https://www.dolfyn.net/index_en.html), an open-source fluid solver written in Fortran. Dolfyn is a face-based, implicit solver that  uses the Finite Volume Method for solving flow equations on unstructured 3D general polyhedral meshes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Dolfyn?\n",
    "* Dolfyn is mature, stable, small and well-tested\n",
    "* Most importantly, Dolfyn's code forms the core of the proprietary industrial solver which MiniCombust was built to investigate.\n",
    "* Dolfyn describes efficient data structures for representing the unstructured computational meshes and how they can be used in massively parallel simulations. We re-use these in MiniCombust\n"

    "## Dolfyn documentation\n",
    "* Sadly, Dolfyn isn't actively maintained. The last official release was in April 2009, and there is no evidence of development since 2010.  \n",
    "* Dolfyn is heavily based on the textbook Ferziger, J.H., Peric, M. (2001), _Computational Methods for Fluid Dynamics_, ISBN 3540420746, 3rd Rev. Ed., Springer, Berlin. It makes sense to get a copy if you need dto work on this code.\n",
    "*  The Dolfyn Developer documentation is at https://www.dolfyn.net/dolfyn/files/devguide_sep2008.pdf and covers some theory, but a 2010 version is at https://www.scribd.com/document/503757573/dolfyn-devguide\n"
