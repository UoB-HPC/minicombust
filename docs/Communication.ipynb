    "## Halo Exchange for Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The unstructured mesh is distributed through the memories of several processes (MPI ranks).\n",
    "Each rank only needs to store the part of the mesh it will be operating on, plus some surrounding cells\n",
    "required for computation. Neighbouring processes will need to exchange the values of border cells to\n",
    "keep values up to ate. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we look at this process in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have an unstructured mesh of cells, in which each MPI rank has several neighbour ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the cells are interior to the MPI rank: no other rank will need their values to be able to\n",
    "calculate the fluid fields. Howeverm some of the cells are \"border cells\", and neighbouring ranks\n",
    "need to know the values in these cells for their calculations. In addition, this rank needs to \n",
    "know values of the adjacent cells to its border cells, which belong to neighbouring ranks: its stores\n",
    "these \"ghost cells\", but never updates their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each timestep calculation, we perform a _halo exchange_ to tell neighbours the new\n",
    "values of our boundary cells, and to receive new values for our \"ghost cells\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, after the partitioning is complete, each process knows statically:\n",
    "* Which are its neighbour ranks\n",
    "* Which cells are border cells, and which neighbour ranks need their values\n",
    "* Which cells are ghost cells, and which neighbour ranks to receive the updated values from\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that each process stores its cells (whether interior, boundary and ghost cells) in a \n",
    "densely packed, contiguous local structure. Each cell has a local id, which identifies the\n",
    "cell in this structure. However, each cell also has a global id, which is the same accross all ranks.\n",
    "Consequently, we store maps that allow local processes to look up the global id for a local cell and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "After partitioning, each process know which global cell ids to send to which neighbour, and which \n",
    "global cell ids to receive from each neighbour. We can precompute some structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A receive buffer, which knows how much data we'll be receiving from each neighbour, and which\n",
    "local cell that represents. This allos us to easily perform an optimised _local scatter_ operation to\n",
    "redistribute these received values from the receive buffer back to their correct position in the local cells array.\n",
    "* Since we know which global cell ids we'll be sending to which neighbour, we can build a densely\n",
    "packed send buffer and perform an optimised _local gather_ operation, which \n",
    "collects the values we want to send from their positions in the local cells array and places them\n",
    "in the densely packed send structure.\n",
