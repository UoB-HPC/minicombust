    "# Physics in MiniCombust\n",

    "Modelling the physics of combustion results in a system of interdependent equations representing chemistry, fluid dynamics (turbulent flow), thermodynamics, heat transfer, mass transfer and two-phase flow. These equations are non-linear PDEs, which we discretise on a computational grid and then solve the system of PDEs for each timestep of a simulation.\n",
