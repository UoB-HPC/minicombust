# MiniCombust
MiniCombust is a mini-app for investigating simulations of combustion in Gas Turbines. MiniCombust uses a Langrangian-Eulerian (particle & FVM flow field solver) approach and incorporates basic models for heat transfer, turbulence, boundary conditions, convection schemes, fuel, soot, spray atomisation and emissions based purely on public-domain work. It is designed for investigating combustion simulations at Exascale, and scales to tens of thousands of cores.

## Design aims:
We'll aim to
* have simple but realistic physics based on public-domain knowledge (no proprietary information)
* provide sample scenarios with known correct answers, with meshes, configurations and run instructions provided. These will help when porting MiniCombust to other languages and architectures.
* provide a canonical implementation in standards-compliant C++17. But MiniCombustâ€™s focus is on the _concepts_ which allow it to scale well rather than language features. Porting to other languages is encouraged.
* focus on achieving good performance at _extreme scale_. While this does not preclude single-node optimisations, optimisations shouldn't detract from the clarity of the implementation. Nothing in the design should make it difficult to use shared-memory intra-node parallelism (e.g. OpenMPI, SYCL) or to target accelerators
* support the ability to model different load-balancing strategies
* make the code should easy to modify, with the focus on _code comprehension_ and _tinkerability_ rather than over-emphasising software engineering concerns such as patterns, DRY, templates etc. The canonical implementation should be written primarily for humans rather than compilers.
* make the code easy to build, with tested support for a wide range of compilers and architectures
* provide living documentation describing the physics and the design choices of the applicatin. We'll adopt a literate programming spirit, and view these docs as equally important as the code, 
* stick to core concerns, and well-tested libraries for auxiliary functions where possible instead of rolling our own. However, we'll also strive to keep the number of dependencies to a minimum, and ensure that the build system manages these well (specifying specific compatible versions etc.). 
* use unit and integration tests that strive for clarity of purpose, forming living documentation and a safety net for regression rather than satisfying arbitrary code coverage.

## Living Documentation
Our documentation lives with the code in this repository, and we use IPython notebooks that describe the application design, physics, references
and runnable snippets that demonstrate concepts.
